Note:
This is just a temporary config file that is a backed up
if anyone else is welcome to using this config file if you're into small laptops and trying to set up a basic i3wm interface
on a smaller screen. I will be updating this more consistenly
------------------------------------------------------------------
Applications to use:
picom
feh
--------------------------------------------------------------------
.Xresources changes the scale to i3wm so will need to create a txt file named .Xresources
then run the command "xrdb ~/.Xresources" this will change the scale globally to all apps on i3wm
